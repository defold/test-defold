# test-defold

This repository contains a Defold project for use when testing the Defold APIs and specific scenarios.

Tests are isolated into independent collections, loaded one by one as collection proxies. Tests are loaded and unloaded in `/tests/tests.script`. Various helpers exist in `/tests/test.lua` to simplify testing.
